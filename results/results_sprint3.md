# Pilot SEAA - Sprint 3 (4 Jan - 17 Jan)

## Work done

**Privacy definions**. All privacy definitions were summarised and published in the README on [GitHub](https://github.com/uashogeschoolutrecht/SEAA).

**Annotation**. Two of the team members annotated 100 cases such that we have a validation file of 200 annotated cases. Anne is on a holiday so we are waiting on him for the last 100 cases, which will bring the total to the goal of 300 cases (>= 10% of total cases).

**Inholland dictionary**. We reached out to Inholland to send us their dictionary. No reply to date.

## Results

SEAA was run on the first 200 annotated cases with the following results:
Efficiency = 72.9%, accuracy = 100%.

## Discussion

SEAA performs a lot better on the actual data than the previously used fake data. However, the sample of 200 annotated cases is a bit small (<10% of total cases), so we could use 100 extra cases.

Efficiency is still a bit low (< 90%), so this will be the focus for the upcoming sprint.
